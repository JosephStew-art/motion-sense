# MotionSense Dataset Analysis Project
## EEE4114F - University of Cape Town
This project uses the MotionSense dataset for the fulfillment of the EEE4114F course at the University of Cape Town (UCT). The project explores machine learning applications on sensor data collected from mobile devices.
## Dataset OverviewThe MotionSense dataset contains time-series data collected from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors of mobile devices. The data includes various activities such as walking, jogging, climbing stairs, and sitting, performed by different subjects with known demographic information.
## Project Structure
This repository is organized into separate folders for different course submissions and a final report:
```Joseph_Stewart_Project/
├── Assignment_1/        # First submission
├── Assignment_2/        # Second submission
├── Assignment_3/        # Third submission
└── Final_Report/       # Comprehensive project report
```
Each folder contains its own analysis, code, and documentation specific to that submission.
